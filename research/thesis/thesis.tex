\begin{abstract}
	Commonsense reasoning is the field of artificial intelligence dedicated to simulating and replicating high level intuition in human beings. 
	Because many higher level human reasoning processes involve knowledge (intuitive or otherwise) about three-dimensional objects, scenes, and situations, and because significant evidence exists indicating that human minds utilize simulations in three-dimensions when thinking, it follows that reasoning in spatial environments is an intuitive and important part of artificial intelligence.
	
	Dr. Lenhart Schubert's Epilog project is a natural language processing venture which is capable of symbolic reasoning of English utterances.
	For spatially-related problems, it makes sense to utilize a 3D simulation.
	
	As a means of supplementing and improve the reasoning capabilities of the Epilog project, and to bring it closer to its goal of accurate simulation of human thought, we chose to create a specialist for reasoning in three dimensions (dubbed the Imagistic Modeling Specialist, \TDS).
	Our project began over the summer and has continued into this year. 
	We have been able to create and implement a system which can successfully place and query entities over a small library of objects and predications.
