% Feb 24, 2010 vandurme> I used a separate header.tex to capture personal
% shortcuts, and included packages. This allowed my to create mini-documents
% based on each chapter, by having a distinct top-level file around each of the
% files "\include"-ed below, that could each then use the same header (so
% changes would be kept in sync):

%\input{header}

\begin{abstract}
	So called “unskilled jobs” such as deli clerks and table waiting in fact require a number of skills to do well; these skills are often learned on the job through experience and mentorship situations. The process could be simplified with instruction written by professionals. Canned Mentorship is a system which allows small groups of professionals to create comprehensive instructions for day-to-day tasks in their jobs for use by newer staff, reducing the need for supervision. This program uses a front-end user interface which allows users to view the instructions as they are being formed and vote on editions and revisions. A back-end server collects the natural language data and parses it to coordinate the groups ideas. The end result is a list of instructions describing a particular task.
