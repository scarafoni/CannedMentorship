    what needs to be done:
        -theory
            -email phillip about survey results
                   -people do lists
                   -not a lot of control flow
                   -ordering is an issue (when to get google maps ready)
            -do a survey with iterative edits (already sent to fan)
            -finalize list of what exactly I'm testing
            -finalize framework for the information flow
        -server
            -find ml framework that'll suite that (including work flow algorithm
            -research flow chart designs
        client
            -bank on using web/javascript
            -find good interface system for drawing diagrams
            -can probably use lists to start
                 -simple html tables for parts of instructions
        -find test group
        -test and write up results

    Best case
         -get whole framework working by the end of the week and start coding
         -finish coding in 2 weeks and start testing
         -can do adversarial concerns
     
    Worst Case
        -can't get good framework
        -slack off so I don't get it done/can't publish
        -can't get good tests in and we can use a crappy framework with bad ML
               -coding the client will be very easy

9/15
    what needs to be done
        -organize different tactics
        -survey spam with different tactics
        -finalize list of what exactly I'm testing

        -server

        -start coding after wednesday
         -finish coding in 2 weeks and start testing
         -can do adversarial concerns
     
    Worst Case
        -slack off so I don't start coding for a while
        -slack off so I don't get it done/can't publish
        -can't get good tests in and we can use a crappy framework with bad ML
               -coding the client will be very easy

10/15
    what needs to be done
        -feature extraction/distance algorithm
        -finish little plug in bits for website
        -user test web site/moar debugging
        -start testing, collect data, begin writing
    best case
        -finish ml stuff by the end of the week, get user testing done in 2
        -start testing
    worst case
        -can't finish program in due time
        -too many bugs
        -have to have some crappy, incomplete testing
        -do testing over winter break/spring semester
