test 1- hash table in java
solo time- 3 min 8 sec
rating- 3 2 2 3 3 4
inst
	make array to hold data
	make hash function 
	make insert, delete, etc methods
	use

obs- trouble remembering how to do task
need to be able to finish at all times
need a few instructions to get people on the same page
revision stage for instruction dev.

tony doesn't liek there's b/c too much detail

final instructions
Create an array whose size is a prime number.
Create a hash function to determine the index of a given object
If the index of an object is already in use by another object, determine a new index using linear probing, quadratic probing, or a secondary hash function.
If the array is out of room, create a larger array (also of prime size) and rehash all entries into the new array.
Continue hashing until all elements are in the table. Lookup can then be used with the same hash function.


test2- same
solo
	time- 3:20
final-
	create a skeleton of a hashtable class in java
	choose how to deal with collisions (separate chaining, linear proping, etc)
	create a hash function (if seperate chaining use array of linked lists)
	create a large instance array in class
